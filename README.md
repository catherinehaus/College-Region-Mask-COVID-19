# College-Region-Mask-COVID-19
For my final project in Quantitative Data Science (QTM) 151: Statistical Computing II, I investigated the relationship between COVID-19 cases and region, as well as COVID-19 cases and reported mask usage in that region. 

To do so, I used the following dataset: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/colleges/colleges.csv'. In my repository, you will find 2 subsets of the data titled 'FIPS_county_state.csv' and 'FIPS_county_state.xlsx'. The code can be found at 'finalprojectqtm151summer_haus.Rmd'. 

I coded all lines except 184-210, which were coded by Hridansh Saraogi, my classmate at Emory University.
