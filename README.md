# College-Region-Mask-COVID-19
For my final project in Quantitative Data Science (QTM) 151: Statistical Computing II, I investigated the relationship between COVID-19 cases and region, as well as COVID-19 cases and reported mask usage in that region. 

To view the code along with its outputs (visualizations, graphs, Shiny applications, etc.), please use the following HTML link: file:///Users/catherinehaus/Desktop/_/Emory/Backfiles_Emory/Summer%20Session%202022/QTM%20151%20Stat%20Comp%20II%202.0/finalprojectqtm151summer_haus.html

To conduct this research, I used the following dataset: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/colleges/colleges.csv'. In my repository, you will find 2 subsets of the data titled 'FIPS_county_state.csv' and 'FIPS_county_state.xlsx'. The code itself can be found at 'finalprojectqtm151summer_haus.Rmd' in my repository.

I coded all lines except 184-210, which were coded by Hridansh Saraogi, my classmate at Emory University.
