# College-Region-Mask-COVID-19
For my final project in Quantitative Data Science (QTM) 151: Statistical Computing II, I investigated the relationship between COVID-19 cases and region, as well as COVID-19 cases and reported mask usage in that region. I coded all lines except lines 184-210 (coded by Hridansh Saraogi).
